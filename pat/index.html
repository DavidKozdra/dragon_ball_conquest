    </p>
    <p><em>IE: a marketing firm but for publicly traded companies</em></p>

    <h2>Understanding Your Role as a Developer</h2>
    <p>
        As a developer, you may be asked to handle various technical tasks, such as fixing printers, websites, databases, etc. 
        Ben Chen will assist with many of these tasks, but the team is not always clear where our jobs end and a technician's begins.
    </p>
    <p>The website and chat bot project are both our responsibilities.</p>
    <p>
        The website is a poorly maintained and never updated LAMP server, with a MySQL database. There is a lot to be done on this front, 
        although it is not the current focus but will be soon.
    </p>
    <p>A lot of the data is handled in Salesforce, which we might also have side projects to handle.</p>
    <p>Here is the current <a href="https://www.redchip.com/chat">product</a>.</p>

    <h2>Client Interactions</h2>
    <p>
        When clients visit our office, it's essential to present a professional image. <strong>Sunday best!</strong> There
        might be lunch and on birthdays. You will know a few days ahead when a client will be there. Suit and tie, the works!
    </p>
    <p>
        Holidays within the stock market down days: <a
            href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/stock-market-holidays-2022-2025-heres-when-the-nyse/431906#:~:text=The%20market%20closes%20on%20New%20Year%27s%20Day%2C%20Martin,Day%2C%20Labor%20Day%2C%20Thanksgiving%20Day%2C%20and%20Christmas%20Day.">Here's
            the list</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Since you will be hourly, you can work whenever; just keep it in mind.</p>

    <h2>Pay Schedule</h2>
    <p>
        Pay dates at REDCHIP occur on the 5th and 20th of every month. Physical checks, not sure yet how they plan to
        handle this if you are remote those days, we do have other remote workers though.
    </p>
    <p>If the 5th or 20th is on a weekend, it would be the closest workday.</p>

    <h2>Stand-Up/Sprint Meetings</h2>
    <p>
        Each day, the entire team joins for stand-up meetings at 8:00 AM. During these meetings, we recap the previous
        day's progress, discuss any challenges encountered, and outline the tasks and priorities for the day ahead. We
        also kickstart our mornings with an inspirational quote to set a positive tone for the day.
    </p>
    <p>Remote call-in number: 407-801-4229.</p>
    <p>I would like to have us meet once a week as a team as we might have a more staggered schedule.</p>

    <h2>Meet Dave Gentry</h2>
    <img src="https://www.redchip.com/assets/images/corporate/dave_book.webp" alt="Dave">
    <p>
        Dave Gentry is the owner and CEO of REDCHIP. With extensive experience in the industry, Dave plays a crucial role
        in guiding our company's strategic direction. While he may not possess in-depth knowledge of software
        development, his leadership and insights have been instrumental in steering numerous large-scale projects to
        success. As the head of the organization, Dave is often referred to as the 'big dog' around here.
    </p>
    <p>He can at times be intense and demanding so keep that in mind, but he is a good guy and overall understands that
        time and other resources are a factor.</p>
    <p>Welcome aboard to the REDCHIP team!</p>
