dragon ball 2d fighting game 

this is my first ever programming project for dragon ball games I think, which is weird cause without a doubt dragon ball in general has been a major inspiration  in my work and in learning to code 

this project is obviously inspired by https://www.txori.com/dbdevolution txori's work in general with a goal to make it more focused on the rules of the manga and anime when it comes to ki control 

- flying cost ki
- ki waves hurt just as ki wave tops do 
- ki blasts touching cause explostions / can be deflected 
- many many missing techniques (do don ray, spirt ball, nemkean arms and growth at will , health/ki transfer)
- kioken stacking (I feel txori puts alot of enifiss on the anime accuracy as in that charictar never did that in the show so its not possible, but I think kioken is not a transformation but a technique)

# character selector 
 the charicter selector is so so unaccessible as it does not allow searching or filterering I would just try to make it 10 times better which tbh the bar is set quite low 



# currently

as it stands the project is in a demo at best I started jun 24th for a few hours and so far progress is good but there is too much to add
